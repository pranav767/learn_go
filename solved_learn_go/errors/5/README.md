The Errors Package
The Go standard library provides an "errors" package that makes it easy to deal with errors.

Read the godoc for the errors.New() function, but here's a simple example:

var err error = errors.New("something went wrong")

Assignment
Textio's software architects may have overcomplicated the requirements from the last coding assignment... oops. All we needed was a new generic error message that returns the string no dividing by 0 when a user attempts to get us to perform the taboo.

Complete the divide function. Use the errors.New() function to return an error when y == 0 that reads "no dividing by 0".

Hint
Remember that it's conventional to return the "zero" values of all other return values when you return a non-nil error in Go.
