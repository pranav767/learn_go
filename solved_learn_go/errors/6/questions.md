errors...



when your fingers are tired and you don't care anymore


when you want to make your code more readable


when you want more control over the error handling


basically never



If you want your program to cleanly exit in an unrecoverable way, which is a good alternative to panic?



log.Fatal()


kill()


fmt.Println()


boos.Exit()
