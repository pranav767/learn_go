Continue & Break
Whenever we want to change the control flow of a loop we can use the continue and break keywords.

continue
The continue keyword stops the current iteration of a loop and continues to the next iteration. continue is a powerful way to use the guard clause pattern within loops.

for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
  if i % 2 == 0 {
    continue
  }
  fmt.Println(i)
}
// 1
// 3
// 5
// 7
// 9

break
The break keyword stops the current iteration of a loop and exits the loop.

for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
  if i == 5 {
    break
  }
  fmt.Println(i)
}
// 0
// 1
// 2
// 3
// 4

Assignment
As an Easter egg, we decided to reward our users with a free text message if they send a prime number of text messages this year.

Complete the printPrimes function. It should print all of the prime numbers up to and including max. It should skip any numbers that are not prime.

Here's the pseudocode:

printPrimes(max):
  for n in range(2, max+1):
    if n is 2:
      n is prime, print it
    if n is even:
      n is not prime, skip to next n
    for i in range (3, sqrt(n), 2):
      if i can be multiplied into n:
        n is not prime, skip to next n
    n is prime, print it

Breakdown
We skip even numbers because they can't be prime
We only check up to the square root of n. A factor higher than the square root of n must multiply with a factor lower than the square root of n, meaning we only need to check up to the square root of n for potential factors.
In your code, you can set the stop condition as i * i <= n
We start checking at 2 because 1 is not prime
This lesson is graded based on the output of your program, so don't leave any debugging print statements in your code.

Example Output
For the first test case, prime number up to 10:

Primes up to 10:
2
3
5
7
===============================================================

We only want you to print the numbers themselves, not the headings and delimiter, they are already handled for you in the test code.

Tip
For the inner loop when a number has a factor, you should use the break keyword to exit the loop early.
