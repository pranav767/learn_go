What is the best reason to keep interfaces small?

- [ ] To reduce the complexity of implementation

- [x] To only define the essential behaviors

- [ ] To make the code more flexible for future changes

**Explanation:**  
Keeping interfaces small ensures they only define the essential behaviors, making them easier to implement and use in different contexts.
