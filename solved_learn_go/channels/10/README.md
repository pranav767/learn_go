Ping Pong
Many tech companies play ping pong in the office during break time. At Mailio, we play virtual ping pong using channels.

Assignment
Run the code as-is. You should see that it doesn't do anything interesting: no ping or pong messages are printed.

Fix the bug in the pingPong function.

Remember: if a program exits before its goroutines have completed, those goroutines will be killed silently. Which of the function calls probably shouldn't run in the background as a goroutine?
