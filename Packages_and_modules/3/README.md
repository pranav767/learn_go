For the majority of this chapter, coding in the browser won't be useful because you need to learn how Go code is organized in a local development environment. For the majority of this chapter, you will use our official CLI tool (written in Go, ofc) to pass off lessons.

Assignment
All instructions on Boot.dev assume a Unix-like environment. If you're on Windows, I recommend using WSL 2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux) to get access to an Ubuntu system.

Install Go 1.23+ locally.

Otherwise, the official download page is also a great option.
Install and login to the bootdev CLI tool. Instructions are on the GitHub page here.
Run and submit the CLI tests.
