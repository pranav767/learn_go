Update Users
We need a way to differentiate between standard and premium users. When a new user is created, they need a membership type, and that type will determine the message character limit.

Assignment

`-  Create a new struct called Membership, it should have:
        A Type string field
        A MessageCharLimit integer field
 -  Update the User struct to embed a Membership.
 -  Complete the newUser function. It should return a new User with all the fields set as you would expect based on the        inputs. If the user is a "premium" member, the MessageCharLimit should be 1000, otherwise, it should only be 100.
